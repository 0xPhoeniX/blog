This one starts the series of more challenging puzzles. The binary is actually a key logger with a twist, writing every pressed key into a log file.

It will try to install itself in your system under `%SystemRoot%` by disguising as `svchost.dll`. It will also add itself under `Run` key to ensure persistence (boring). The interesting things are waiting for us latter on.

As I mentioned previously, this key-logger has a twist – each key press is monitored by `GetAsyncKeyState` which is running in the loop. Once the pressed key generated a character, it will be passed to a processing *switch* statement:

The twist here is that the “secret” message was encoded by the means of flags that in the beginning all are initialized by `init_secret_flags`. Each flag represents the letter in the final “secret” message and the keys must be pressed in the particular order.

If there is an error in the sequence, for example pressing *4*, everything will be reset (Fig.4 – 2) – `init_secret_flags`called again. On the other hand, *i* will be somewhere in the final “secret” message (Fig. 4 – 3) as the next flag is set to ‘on’ state.

The way to solve this puzzle is rather simple – just follow the flags in IDA (for example, using XRefs) where the particular flag is compared with *0* and write down the letter that is processes by that function. Pay attention, that the first flag is already set in `init_secret_flags`. Let’s walk the process for first 2 characters:

- find reference for first flag where it is compared with 0
- write down the character (‘l’)
- find reference for second flag where it is compared with 0
- write down the character (‘0’ – zero)

Once done, you should see the following:
