This challenge is about analyzing a binary file. Using IDA. we see here a sort of “obfuscation” where the actual code (payload) is moved into the stack by the loader and executed from there:

The payload is actually a multi-stage `xor` based, self decrypting code which in our case has various funny sentences revealed in every decrypted part:

| Stage                                                    | Result |
| :--------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------: |
| ![img](/images/flare_ch3_st1.png) | ![img](/images/flare_ch3_st1_res.png)|
| ![img](/images/flare_ch3_st2.png) | ![img](/images/flare_ch3_st2_res.png)|

I hope, you’ve got the idea here. I’ll omit several stages and come straight to the last meaningful stage where the email we’ve been looking for is revealed:
